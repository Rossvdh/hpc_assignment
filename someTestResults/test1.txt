TEST 1----------------------------------------
start timer
for each timestep:
 	read timestep
	for each a: (parallelised here)
		calculate distance to each b
	back to serial
	sort and get k shortest distances
	write out to file
stop timer
done

TEST 2------------------------------------------------
dcd file has been opened
read timestep data into vector
close dcd file
start timer
for each timestep: (parallelised here)
	for each a:
		calculate distance to each b
	add to writeToFile vector
back to serial
end timer
sort writeToFile
write output to file
done
